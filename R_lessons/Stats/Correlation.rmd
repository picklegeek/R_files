Corelation tells the amount of linear relationship between variables
A value of 1 indicates a straight linear relationship, 0 indicates a non linear one
 ```{r}
 library(ggplot2)
 library(dplyr)
 mtcars %>% group_by(gear) %>% summarize(N=n(), r = cor(mpg,wt))
 ggplot(mtcars,aes(mpg,wt,color = factor(gear))) + geom_point()

 ```
